Disease can negatively impact plant health before any visible signs like leaf discolouration show. While these stresses are invisible to the naked eye, cameras using special filters could detect these subtle changes. The drone will use Multi-spectral cameras, which uses special filters to capture reflected light from selected regions of the large crop field. The innovation of this project involves developing a solution to detect and classify infection in the crop. This project can be implemented using drones and their multi-spectral sensors, as well as developing tools to train a computer program to analyse the images and classify them based on disease progression.
